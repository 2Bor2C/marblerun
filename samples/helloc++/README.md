# C++ sample
This sample shows how to build a confidential C++ application and run it in Mesh. This should serve as a blueprint for making existing applications Mesh-ready or creating new ones.

You can build and run this app similar to the [Go helloworld sample](../helloworld/README.md).

This sample requires [libertmeshpremain](../../libertmeshpremain/README.md) to be installed.
